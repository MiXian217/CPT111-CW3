# CPT111-CW3
This repository contains my submission for CW3 in the CPT111 module. The project is a data visualization tool built from scratch in Java to generate Sankey diagrams. The program is designed to apply and demonstrate a fundamental understanding of object-oriented principles, file processing, data structures, and graphics concepts using JavaFX.
